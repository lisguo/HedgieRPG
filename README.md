# HedgieRPG
A 2D traditional role-playing game starring Chestnut, a young woman who sets out to find her missing husband Pinecone. Through hordes of enemies, she discovers friendships and ultimately, difficult foes. Can she bring her husband back in peace?

# Inspiration
- The characters were all inspired by my stuffed animals. I have hedgehogs named Pinecone and Chestnut, who became the main characters of this game.
- Gameplay was inspired by Final Fantasy.
